a) What is normalization and why is it needed?

Ans. Normalization is a process of organizing the data in the database to avoid the dupliciency of data.


b) What is the 2NF? Explain with an example. You donâ€™t need to draw the
tables or write the queries. Just mention the schema before and after the
third normal form.


Ans.  2nd normal form conditions:
       1. It should be in 1 normal form.
       2. It should not have any partial dependencies.

       A is super key
       B is prime attrubute
       C is non prome attrubute
       A---->B and B---->C and A---->C
